##  My App: Sample Size Calculator
- This app is designed to calculate sample sizes
- This formula assumes a known large population size (i.e 30 or greater) without replacement
- The app asks for user input of Population Size, Margin of Error, Confidence Level, and Population proportion and displays the calculated sample size 


## Methodology
- Formula:
![Formula](formula image.jpg)
-  where
    - n = sample size
    - N = population size
    - MOE = Margin of error
    - z = Z-score (obtained from confidence level)
    - p = population proportion

## Methodology (Cont.)

- The distribution used to obtain the z value is the normal distribution
- Formula taken from https://stattrek.com/sample-size/simple-random-sample
